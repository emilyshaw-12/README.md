I'm currently a senior at Binghamton University studying Chemistry and Digital & Data Studies. Under the supervision of Dr. Alistair Lees, I conduct photochemical research on the synthesis and use of anion sensors. I minored in Digital Data Studies and took many programming courses, learning Python, R, HTML, and CSS. 

I spent Summer 2024 as a Product Development Research Intern at INFICON. This opportunity gave me experience working in product development of new GC-MS systems.
